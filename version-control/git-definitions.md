# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files. It is useful because the user could add new changes changes or revert back to an older version if necessary.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is when a user takes a copy of the master branch to make changes to without actually affecting the master branch. It is useful because multiple users could work on their own branches simultaneously without affecting the master branch. It is also useful because they can merge their branches to add their changes to the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a command that records the changes to the repository. A good commit message will specify exactly what changes were made to the file(s) by the user.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches both modify the same parts of a file so when they are merged, git does not know which of the changes to keep.
