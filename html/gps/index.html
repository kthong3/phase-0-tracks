  		<p>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  		<br>Sematic tags are used to clearly describe its meaning to both the browser and the user since it describes its content. I think the most useful tags are the main, nav, article and section tags. </p>

		<p>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
		<br> head -> body -> main -> footer (if applicable)</p>

		<p>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
		<br>I found how to create a new snippet in Sublime but I did not realize there was more to it than just simply creating it. I think I will consider using the snippets more often as we go along with creating more content.</p>

		<p>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
		<br>Learning how to create and use the snippet was a bit difficult to understand at first but my pair was very thorough with applying what he learned and how to create the snippet from the resource that he shared with me and our guide. I will definitely look into that further to have a better understanding about snippets in Sublime. Another concept I felt like I got stuck on was where each element should go since some of them could be nested within each other and some couldn't. I'm sure we'll be using these semantic tags often so I'll be sure to look into it more often and always keep validating the html before submitting anything.
